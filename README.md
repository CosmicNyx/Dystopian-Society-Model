# Dystopian Society Model Documentation

This comprehensive documentation outlines the evolution of the mathematical models used to simulate dynamics within a dystopian society, inspired by ecological theories and literary influences. It provides a detailed explanation of how the model has expanded from the basic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey dynamics to encompass complex societal interactions, chaos theory, and the implications of advanced technology.

## Introduction to Lotka-Volterra Equations

The Lotka-Volterra equations are fundamental to ecological and biological modeling, primarily focusing on the interactions between two species: predators and prey. These equations are pivotal for understanding the cyclical nature of these interactions:

- **Prey Population Dynamics:**
  $$\frac{dx}{dt} = \alpha x - \beta xy$$
  - \(x\): Prey population.
  - \(\alpha\): Prey's natural growth rate in the absence of predation.
  - \(\beta\): Predation rate at which prey are consumed.

- **Predator Population Dynamics:**
  $$\frac{dy}{dt} = \delta xy - \gamma y$$
  - \(y\): Predator population.
  - \(\delta\): Efficiency at which predators convert prey into additional predators.
  - \(\gamma\): Natural death rate of predators.
